# Counting Techniques in Probability and Combinatorics

## Introduction

Counting techniques are foundational tools in probability theory and combinatorics, providing rigorous methods for enumerating the number of ways events can occur. This chapter develops key principles—product rules, permutations (including repeated elements), $k$-permutations, and combinations—emphasizing precise definitions, formal proofs, and the combinatorial underpinnings of basic probability distributions. All notation is introduced as needed, and terminology follows international mathematical conventions.

## Product Rule

### Formal Definition

Let $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ be finite sets representing the possible outcomes of $n$ independent experiments. The product rule states that the number of ordered tuples $(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n)$ with $a_i \in A_i$ is given by:

$$
|A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots \times A_n| = |A_1| \cdot |A_2| \cdots |A_n|
$$

where $|A|$ denotes the cardinality of set $A$ [@Billingsley1995].

### Proof

Since the experiments are independent, for each choice $a_1 \in A_1$, there are $|A_2|$ choices for $a_2$, and so on. By induction:

* Base case $n=1$: $|A_1|$.
* Inductive step: Assume true for $n=k$. For $n=k+1$,

  $$
  |A_1 \times \cdots \times A_k \times A_{k+1}| = (|A_1| \cdots |A_k|) \cdot |A_{k+1}|.
  $$

Thus, the rule holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

**Example:** Suppose an urn contains 6 red and 4 black balls ($10$ total). Two balls are drawn in sequence **without replacement**. Compute the total number of ordered outcomes:

Let $A_1$ = set of balls for the first draw ($|A_1|=10$); $A_2$ = set of balls for the second draw ($|A_2|=9$ since one has been removed). The total number of ordered pairs is $10 \times 9 = 90$.

Suppose we want the number of ways both balls are red. There are 6 choices for the first red ball and 5 for the second (since no replacement). Thus, $6 \times 5 = 30$ ordered favorable outcomes.

The probability both are red:

$$
P(\text{both red}) = \frac{30}{90} = \frac{1}{3}
$$

**Example:** Link to Probability Spaces. If instead balls were drawn **with replacement** (each draw independent), the total number of ordered pairs would be $10 \times 10 = 100$, illustrating the effect of independence.

## Permutations

### Definition

A **permutation** of a finite set $S$ with $|S|=n$ is a bijection $\pi: S \to S$, or equivalently, an ordered arrangement of all $n$ elements [@Stanley2012]. The number of permutations is:

$$
n! = n \cdot (n-1) \cdots 2 \cdot 1
$$

### Proof

Each position in the ordered arrangement has a unique element assigned, with $n$ choices for the first, $n-1$ for the second, ..., $1$ for the last.

**Example:** Arrange $5$ distinct books on a shelf. The number of arrangements is $5! = 120$.

**Example:**Permutation Parity. For $n \geq 2$, half of all permutations are even and half are odd, a result crucial in the theory of determinants and algebraic structures [@Durrett2019].

## $k$-Permutations (formerly “Variations”)

### Terminology and Definition

A **$k$-permutation** (standard English) of an $n$-element set is an ordered selection of $k$ distinct elements ($0 \leq k \leq n$). The number is:

$$
P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n - k)!}
$$

### Proof

For the first position, $n$ choices; second, $n-1$; up to $k$ positions:

$$
n \cdot (n-1) \cdots (n-k+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
$$

**Example:**

Select and order $3$ out of $5$ books: $P(5,3) = 60$.

### Constraints

If $k > n$, $P(n,k)=0$ since selection without repetition is impossible.

### Conceptual Distinction

* Permutations: All $n$ elements, order matters.
* $k$-Permutations: Subset of $k$ elements, order matters.
* Combinations: Subset of $k$ elements, order does **not** matter.

## Combinations

### Definition

A **combination** is an unordered selection of $k$ elements from an $n$-element set:

$$
C(n,k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} = \binom{n}{k}
$$

The notation $\binom{n}{k}$ is standard.

### Support: Hypergeometric Probability

When sampling $k$ elements without replacement from a population of $n$ objects, of which $m$ are “special” (e.g., defective), the probability that exactly $s$ are special is given by the **hypergeometric distribution**:

$$
P(\text{$s$ special}) = \frac{\binom{m}{s} \binom{n-m}{k-s}}{\binom{n}{k}}
$$

[@Feller1970]

**Example:**

From $50$ components ($4$ defective), select $10$ at random. The probability that **at least one** is defective:

$$
P(\geq 1 \text{ defective}) = 1 - \frac{\binom{46}{10}}{\binom{50}{10}}
$$

### Numerical Example (Small Scale)

From $6$ objects ($2$ defective), choose $3$:

* Total ways: $\binom{6}{3}=20$
* Ways with no defective: $\binom{4}{3}=4$
* $P(\text{at least one defective})=1-\frac{4}{20}=0.8$

## Permutations with Repeated Elements

### Definition

Given a multiset of $n$ objects where $n_1$ are of type $1$, $n_2$ of type $2$, ..., $n_k$ of type $k$ (with $n_1+\cdots+n_k=n$), the number of distinct permutations is:

$$
\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\cdots n_k!}
$$

### Proof

There are $n!$ ways to permute all objects if they were distinguishable. For each group of indistinguishable elements, dividing by $n_i!$ corrects for the overcount due to repeated arrangements [@Stanley2012].

**Example:**

Number of distinct anagrams of “BANANA” ($3$ A’s, $2$ N’s, $1$ B):

$$
\frac{6!}{3!2!1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
$$

## Maxwell–Boltzmann Model

### Physical Context and Assumptions

The Maxwell–Boltzmann model describes the number of ways to distribute $r$ **distinguishable** particles into $n$ **distinguishable** boxes (“urns”), with no restriction on occupancy [@Feller1970]. Each particle is assigned independently to a box.

### Formula and Derivation

For each of $r$ particles, there are $n$ box choices:

$$
N = n^r
$$

**Example:**

Distribute $3$ labeled balls into $2$ boxes: $2^3 = 8$ configurations.

## Bose–Einstein Model

### Physical Context and Assumptions

The Bose–Einstein model addresses distributing $r$ **indistinguishable** particles into $n$ **distinguishable** boxes, allowing any number of particles per box [@Feller1970].

### Formula and Proof

Configurations correspond to solutions of $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n = r$ with $x_i \geq 0$, counted by:

$$
N = \binom{r+n-1}{r}
$$

This follows from the “stars and bars” theorem.

**Example:**

Place $4$ indistinguishable balls in $3$ boxes:

$$
\binom{4+3-1}{4} = \binom{6}{4} = 15
$$

## Distributions Derived from Maxwell–Boltzmann: Binomial and Poisson

### Binomial Distribution Derivation

If each of $r$ distinguishable particles independently enters one of $n$ urns with equal probability $1/n$, the probability that a fixed urn contains exactly $k$ particles:

$$
p(k) = \binom{r}{k} \left( \frac{1}{n} \right)^k \left( 1-\frac{1}{n} \right)^{r-k}
$$

This is the **binomial distribution** with parameters $r$ (trials), $p=1/n$ (success probability).

### Poisson Limit

As $n \to \infty$, $r \to \infty$ with $\lambda = r/n$ fixed,

$$
p(k) \to e^{-\lambda} \frac{\lambda^k}{k!}
$$

This is the **Poisson distribution** [@Billingsley1995].

**Example:**

Suppose $r=10$, $n=100$, fixed urn: $p(0)=\left(1-\frac{1}{100}\right)^{10} \approx 0.904$.

## Distributions Derived from Bose–Einstein: Geometric

### Geometric Distribution from Occupancy

In the Bose–Einstein model, in the limit $n \to \infty$, $r/n \to \lambda$, the probability that a fixed box contains exactly $k$ indistinguishable particles is:

$$
p(k) = \frac{\lambda^k}{(1+\lambda)^{k+1}}
$$

### Derivation

The result follows from analytic combinatorics by considering the limit of multinomial occupancy [@Feller1970].

**Example:**

Let $\lambda = 2$, $k=3$:

$$
p(3) = \frac{2^3}{(1+2)^{4}} = \frac{8}{81} \approx 0.0988
$$
